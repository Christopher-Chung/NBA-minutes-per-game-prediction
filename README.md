# NBA-minutes-per-game-prediction

This is a quick, fun prediction of NBA players' minutes-per-game using their on-court production rates. '19-'20 data is used for training, and '18-'19 data is used as validation data; I used random forest as a quick model. Model achieves 0.55~0.6 R-squared on the validation set. 

Data is acquired from https://www.nbastuffer.com/.
